## Unity Script Event Manager

A standalone library of a simple scripted event manager I use. Events can be coded manually or designed like any other regular Unity component.

SampleScene has an example of how the pre-existing events can be configured in the Unity editor.

SampleScene2 has an example of using a ComposableScriptedEventAction to utilize a more code-centric methodology of creating scripted events
